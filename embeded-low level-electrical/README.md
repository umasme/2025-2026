# 🚀 ASME Lunabotics 2026 University of Miami – Electrical Subsystem

Welcome to the official repository for the electrical subsystem of the University of Miami’s ASME Lunabotics team for the **2026 NASA Lunabotics Competition**.

---

This repository documents the design, implementation, and testing of the rover’s electrical system, emphasizing high reliability, efficiency, and simplicity.

# 2026 Design Goals

- Design an effective system with high reliability, minimal points of failure, and strategic redundancies while keeping it simple with minimal components and maximum efficiency.

- Focus on real-time data logging of current, voltage, power, temperature, and speed for post-analysis and future optimization.

- Reduce wiring complexity by using multiplexed communication protocols.

- Ensure reliable wired communication and power distribution to motors and other subsystems.
